 * // Create two objects, we retain a strong reference on first,
 * // but don't use `second` anywhere else so it will be deleted soon.

 * registry.add(KEY, first)
 * registry.add(KEY, second)
 *
 * // here, both objects are still active and haven't been deleted yet.
 * console.log(registry.get(KEY)) // <-- "[first, second]"
 *
 * // let's set a timeout and wait for half a minute.
 * setTimeout(() => {
 *   // we use `first` here, so JS doesn't delete it. the reference is still strong.
 *   // notice however that we do not use `second` in here, no code is referencing
 *   // it anymore. the JS engine probably already deleted the `second` object. (garbage collector)
 *   console.log(`First is still alive: ${first != null}`) // true
 *
 *   // as we can see, the registry now only returns the `first` object.
 *   // the `second` object has been deleted by the JS engine's garbage collector.
 *   console.log(registry.get(KEY)) // <-- "[first]"
 * }, 30000)
